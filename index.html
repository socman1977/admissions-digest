<h3>Action checklist (parents & student)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Check applicant portals & email (including Spam/Promotions) for each school.</li>
<li>If interviews are scheduled: prepare 2–3 stories + 60-sec “Why major/Why school” and send thank-you after.</li>
<li>Verify FAFSA/CSS/IDOC completeness; fix missing documents.</li>
<li>If you have a meaningful update (rank/award/project): draft a short 150–200 word update (only where allowed).</li>
<li>Treat Reddit timing/rumors as anecdotal; cross-check with official school communications.</li>
